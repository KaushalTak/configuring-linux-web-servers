The Rule of least privilege
Specific has only permissions required by him thats it


Becoming a super user
We don't sign in as super user / root but another user who can run command as super user  using root. helps prevent hacking


sudo vs. su
Best practice to not use su command. You can forget you are su and can do damage. No warnings are given.


Package Source list
List of various places we can go to get software. Package source list. All available package sources are listed in
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
Each of the rpos in above list will be referenced when we try to update or install new software


Updating available package list
Keep software upto date for security. Most don't update because changes may caause issue.
update by 
sudo apt-get update
The update command will run through all of the reposwe saw within /etc/apt/sources.list file, and it will check what all the software is available and what verions. THis command makes no changes to system. Just makes aware of latest software and versions


Upgrading Installed Packages
sudo apt-get upgrade
This early in the system you can upgrade everything. Later on when you actually have your web application running on this system, review list and test on non-production server.

Using Finger
finger displays info about users currently logged in
can pass user name to display extra info


Introduction to /etc/passwd/
Finger gets this info from /etc/passwd/. It store info about each user
cat /etc/passwd
Each line entry for single user
This is a very important file on your system! It's used to keep track of all users on the system. Run cat /etc/passwd and look at the output; each line is organized in this format:

username:password:UID:GID:UID info:home directory:command/shell

Let’s run through what each of those mean:
username: the user’s login name
password: the password, will simply be an x if it’s encrypted
user ID (UID): the user’s ID number in the system. 0 is root, 1-99 are for predefined users, and 100-999 are for other system accounts
group ID (GID): Primary group ID, stored in /etc/group.
user ID info: Metadata about the user; phone, email, name, etc.
home directory: Where the user is sent upon login. Generally /home/
command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (usually /bin/bash). Does not have to be a shell though!


INtroduction to User Management
It's a common pattern to diable ability to log in as root, and to only login as a different user that has the ability to use Sudo. This is a security measure since every bad guy out there knows every linux box has user named root. By disabling this account from remote login we remove a very easy attack vector. Now vagrant took care of this for us. They created a user name vagrant and we just type vagrant ssh from our terminal to automatically connect. BUt not every hosting provider is going to set something like this up for you. SO let's do this ourselves.
